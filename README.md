Hello, this my Task Manager project.

In this project i wanted to create a simple task manager with python. It's common to see a lot of task managers, but i wanted to try to create one by myself. You may ask why? Well, i tend to forget things, and i want to have a simple task manager that i can use to remember things that i have to do(perfect for me). Some tasks that i have to do are not so time sensitive, so i can just mark task as low priority and do it when i have time. Others are more time sensitive, so i can mark them as high priority and do them as soon as possible, for now it's main idea is simple, but i want to add more features in the future. Ofcorse, it has other features, deleting tasks, marking tasks as done, viewing tasks(by priority, by status or just all tasks) and sending emails with tasks(only to my email for now). In this particular project I tried to look for all the possible errors and handle them, so it's more user friendly and i can add more functionality in the future without worrying about unhandled errors. I also tried to make it as simple as possible, so it's easy to use and understand.

Other features that i want to add in the future:
- Add more options to view tasks
- Add more options to sort tasks
- Add more options to send to other emails
- Add more options to change tasks
- Add more options to categorize tasks
- Add more options to search tasks
- Add more options to change priority
- Add more options to change date
- Add more options to change description
- Add more options to change title
